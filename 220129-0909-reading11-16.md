## Investment Process
> Investors make two decisions in constructing their portfolios
1. Asset Allocation - which of the asset classes to invest in (i.e. stocks, bonds, real estate, etc)
2. Security Selection - which particular securities within which asset class

**Approaches**
* TopDown > choosing asset allocation then selecting securities
* BottomUp > choosing specific securities, based on investment oppurtunity, without
  regard for the asset class

  
## Competitive Markets
* In the securities market, there is a **risk-return tradeoff** such that 
  higher risk invesmtents have higher expected returns, than lower risk assets
	* [Diversification](220129-1044-diversification)
* Since it is rare to find bargains in such a competitive market, the hypothesis that
  the market is efficient was developed
  	* [Efficient-Market-Hypothesis](220129-1050-efficient-market-hypothesis)
	* passive management - Buying and holding a diversified portoflio without attempting to identify mispriced securities
	* active management - attempting to identify mispriced securities or to forecast broad market trends
