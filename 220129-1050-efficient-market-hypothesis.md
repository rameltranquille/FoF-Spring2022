> According to the hypothesis, as new information about an asset becomes available, 
its price quickly adjusts so that at any time, the price of the security is equal to
the consensus estimate of the value of the security. Thus securities in the market
are always efficiently priced. 

## Implications
- Passive Management: holding a highly diversified portfolio without spending effort or other resources
  attempting to improve performance through security analysis. 
- Active Management: Attemp to improve performance either by identifying mispriced securities or 
  by timing the performance of broad asset calsses
  
> However, the hypothesis cannot be fully true (as of today). If it were, there would be no reason for
active management of investment portfolios and securities would soon stop being "efficiently priced."
Thus, it is said that the market is *near-efficient* and that creative
and diligent investors can find opportunities for profit
