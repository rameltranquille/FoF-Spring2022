# Multiple Assets Covariance
- The **covariance** between two returns is the average of the products of their deviations from the mean:

$$
Cov(R_i,R_j) = E([R_i-E(R_i)][R_j-E(R_j)])
$$

- *Positive* if the random variables tend to be unsually high at the same time
- *Negative* if the one variable tends to be high when the other is low


## Correlation

$$
Corr[R_i,R_j] = \ro = \frac{Cov[R_i,R_j]}{\sigma_i \sigma_j}
$$

- $\rho$ always between -1 and 1
- $\rho=1$  means perfect correlations (identical risk)
- $\rho=0$  means uncorrelation (independent risk)
- $\rho=-1$  means negative correlation (opposite risks)
