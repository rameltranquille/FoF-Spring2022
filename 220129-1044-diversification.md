* **Diversification** > Many assets are held within the portfolio, limiting the exposure to risk
  of any asset
    - Do not put all yours eggs in one basket
    - Implications for portfolio choice


## Modeling Risk
* involves *scenarios* and *probabilities*
 
- Scenarios: $s = 1,2.. S$ to consider
    + $R(s)$ is the realized return in scenario $s$ 
    + Probabilities $p(s)$ for scenario $s$
    + summary statistics (*expected return/mean return* and *STD/volatility*)
      
### Expected Return

- Expected Return   
	$$
	E[R] = \Sigma^{S}_{S=1}p(s)R(s)
	$$

- Variance = Expected Squared Deviation
$$
\sigma^2[R] = \Sigma^{S}_{S=2}p(s)(R(S) - E[R])^2
$$

- STD ($\sigma$, volatility)
	$$
	\sigma[R] = \Sigma^{S}_{S=2}p(s)(R(S) - E[R]) \text{  OR  } \sigma = \sqrt{Variance}
    	$$
