> There are three broad types of financial assets: fixed income, equity, and derivatives

## Fixed Income
***Fixed Income*** (or debt securities) promise a fixed recurring payment from
some issuer. Thus, the investment performance of debt securities is least closely tied to
the financial condition of the issuer. There are many different types of 
fixed income assets, with different interests, provisions, and maturities.

1. *money market* == debt securities that are "highly marketable" and low risk generally
2. *capital market* == long term securities such as treasury bonds
 	* These bonds have a wide range of risk (low: treasury securities -- high: junk bonds)
	* many of these come with provisions to protect the investor against the issuers' bankruptcy


## Equity 
***Equity*** in a firm represents an ownerhship share in that company
1. Not promised any particular payment.
2. Recieve dividends at the discretion of the issuing company, based on its real assets 
3. Equity value changes with the value of the underlying firm and its real assets.
   * Equity investments are the most risky, since theyre tied directly to the success of the firm

## Derivative Securities
***Derivative Securities*** (Ex: options, futures contracts) are determined by the price
of other assets

*Q* Why are derivatives useful???
1. Can be used to hedge risks, or push risk to other parties > risk management
2. Can be used for speculative positions

THUS
Wherever there is uncertainty, investors may be interested in trading, either to
speculate or to lay off their risks, and a market may arise to meet that demand
