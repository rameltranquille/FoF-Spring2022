- Bonds are traded among investors after issuance. 
- Loans are difficult to trade and usually remain on the balance sheet of the originating bank

## Mortgages
**Mortgage:** A loan secured by a piece of real estate, which are used by households and firms 
to make purchases without paying the entirety upfront. 

*Note:* Unlike bonds and traditional loans, payments on mortages are fixed (usually 15- to 30-years), but can be adjusted

## Equity
- Cash flows: **Dividends** or stock repurchases
- Future cash-flows are not fixed but uncertain
- Maturity is indefinity
- Valuation: TVM + *risk adjustment*

There are two main classes of equities
- Common Stock: voting rights ("junior")
- Preferred Stock: non-voting rights ("senior")

	+ Valuation: TVM + risk + *option adjustment*
	+ A Call (Put) **Option** = the right to buy (sell) the underlying asset at a *specified price* (strike price) 
	  and on a *specified date* (maturity)
	+ A Long (Short) **Futures** = Obligation to buy (sell) the underlying asset at a *specified price* (strike price) 
	  and on a *specified date* (maturity)
