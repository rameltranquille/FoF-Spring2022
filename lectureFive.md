## Portfolio 

- A combination of N assets
- Portfolio $p$, with portfolio weights $w_1,...,w_n$	
	- $w_i$ is percentage of weather invested in asset $i$
     
$$
w_i = \frac{\text{Value of Stock i's position}}{\text{total value of Portfolio}}
$$

* Note: A negative weight indicates a short position
* *Important:* Portfolio weights sum to one: $w_1 +...+ w_n = 1$

### Realized Returns 
The realized return on the portfolio is the weighted average return 

$$
R = w_AR_A + w_BR_B
$$

- When either R_A or R_B is risky, so is R. You do not know *today* what R will be *tomorrow*.	
  If there is good news, R might be high. If not, R might be negative.
- Thus, we can instead compute [Expected Return](220129-1044-diversification#Expected Return)


### Volatility -  [Volatility](220215-1748-volatility)

### Portfolio Vocabulary
+ **Investment Opportunity Set** - consists of all available risk-return combinations
+ **Efficient Portfolio** - a portfolio that has the highest possible expected return for   
  a given STD
+ **Efficient Frontier** - the set of efficient portfolios. It is the upper portion 
  of the minimum variance frontier starting at the minimum variance portfolio
+ **Minimum Variance Portfolio (MVP)** - the portfolios that provides the lowest variance 
  (STD) among all possible portfolios of risky assets


**Efficient Frontier**: Investment Opportunity Set with Different Correlations
