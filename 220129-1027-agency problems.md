	* Compensation plans tie the income of managers to the success of the firm (e.g. shares and stock options)
	* separate ownership and management allow for managers to be replaced when underperforming OR a board entirely
	* Outsiders such as security analysts or institutional investors provide a sort of checks and balances,
	  that can make managers/firms "uncomfortable"
	* **Activist investors** have also staged takeovers of poorly managed firms, called a *proxy contest*
	* Other firms can also stage more legitimate takeovers. 
	* *To overcome agency problems, federal regulators pass acts such as the Dodd-Frank Act or Sarbanes-Oxley Act*
	  *with requirements for corporate governance and executive actions*
