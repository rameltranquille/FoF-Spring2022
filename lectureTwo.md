- **Primary transaction** is when the financial asset (loan, bond, or share) is created
- **Secondary transaction** is when the existing asset is bought and sold by investors
- *Note:* Primary and secondary markets are connected!

## Primary Markets
In primary transactions, assets can be sold by
1. **Auctions:** When the borrower is well known, it can sell securities directly to the public, such as big governments 
2. **Underwriting**: Otherwise, employees of investment banks underwrite the deal (for bonds, stocks, and municipals)

**Underwriters:** a syndicate of investment banks
- Firm commitment: Underwriters buy, take the risk
- Best effort: Underwriters dont buy
**Direct Listing:** No underwriter
**SPAC:** Special purpose acquisition companies
- Shell companies raising money through IPOs, before merging with actual target company
 
-------------------------------------
## Secondary Markets
### Brokers
Investors usually trade through **brokers**
- Brokers help investors trade without themselves taking positions, earning them
	* Brokerage fees
	* Payment for order flow (PFOF)
- Broker guarantees that:
	* Buyer can pay
	* Seller can deliver security
	
### Dealers = Market Makers
Unlike brokers, **dealers** buy and sell themselves and thus take inventory risk, providing two services
- Immediacy and liquidity
- Price of this liquidity service: bid-ask spread

#### Bid/Ask Spread
**Ask:** The price at which you can BUY is called the 
**BID:** The price at which you can SELL is called the 

Thus, $ask > bid$ is always true, and dealers make the bid/ask spread (= $ask - bid$)

*Q* What determines the bid-ask spread?
- Volume of trade
- Volatility of Equilibrium Price
- Competition between dealers

### Orders
- **Market Orders** - Immediate execution at whatever price is available
- **Limit orders** - Sell/Buy limit order = Sell/Buy if price above/below X
- **Stop orders** - Stop Loss/Buy orders = Sell/Buy if the price is below/above X

### Trading Cost
**Explicit Cost:** (commission) fee paid to broker for making the transaction  
**Implicit Cost:** Bid-ask spread
- Implicit cost for larger orders have a **market impact**
	+ deep market = small market impact
	+ thin market = big market impact

### Buying on Margin
Buying on margin = when one borrows money from a broker to purchase securities
- Investor pays margin, borrows the rest from broker (margin loan), at some fee/rate
	
For a **margin call,** Securities must be kept by broker as collateral (protects agaisnt defaults)
	+ However they can still incur risk if the stock drops too far 

### Short Sales
**Shorting:** Selling shares of a firm not owned by borrowing security and later covering it
- A profit is made if the short position is covered at a price lower than the one at which it was established
- A bearish investment or as a hedge
- Requirements
	1. Short sale proceeds must remain with the broker
	2. The investor is also required to deposit collateral as a guarantee against default

-------------------------------------
## Short Squeeze
- If price starts going up, short-seller faces potential unbounded losses
	+ may be forced to cover if margin call
- Price rises further if some short sellers want to cover
	+ Causing other short-sellers to try to cover, while owners refuse to lends and demand collateral shares
